# GIF-O-MATIC

## description:

This program adds 10 gifs based on the button pressed at the top. The three gifs provided don't really have a cohesive theme, just things that come to my mind when I search for gifs.  I also decided to add a reset button for the gif buttons, which resets them back to their original state without refreshing the page. I also added some validation to the button adding function to prevent users from submitting empty buttons or duplicates of buttons already up there. 

## Instructions:

Simply clone the repo and run index.html
